<b>Problem Statements:</b><br>
<li>List all the clients and their associated total job expenses. If there is a client who did not post any job, 
or no invoice was generated for the posted jobs, the total expense should appear as zero for that client. 
Your query should list the details in three columns, 'Client Number', 'Client Name', 'Total Job Expense'. 
<b>(Hint: the invoice table lists the expenses for the jobs)</b>.</li>
<li>List the seminar titles, and date on which they were held, along with the number of participants, 
for the seminars arranged during the afternoon part of the day (between 12 PM and 3 PM). 
Count 1 participation for each elite member even if the elite member is a trade union. </li>
